Introduction:
The Problem
Remembering to take medication at the correct time can be a challenge, especially when
managing multiple prescriptions with varying schedules. While forgetting a daily multivitamin
may be harmless, missing doses of essential medications can pose significant health risks.

The Solution:

Imagine having a device that not only reminds you when it’s time to take your medicine but
also dispenses the correct pills for you. This project aims to create an automatic medicine
dispenser that does just that, ensuring you never miss a dose.

Why an Automatic Pill Dispenser?

For those who take medication more than once a day or different medications at different times,
the task of remembering each dose can be daunting. Traditional pill organizers, like the one
shown below, help but still rely on your memory or a separate alarm to take the medication.
An automatic pill dispenser integrates the functionality of a pill organizer with the convenience
of an alarm system. Pre-loaded with your medications, the dispenser automates the process by:
     1.Dispensing the correct amount of medication at scheduled times.
     2.Providing audible and visual reminders to take your medication.


Project Overview
In this project, we will build an Arduino-based automatic pill dispenser. This device uses a
servo motor to rotate a paddle wheel with compartments for different pills. A real-time clock
(RTC) keeps track of time, and at the scheduled times, the servo motor rotates to release the
correct pills into a tray. Additional features include:
 Liquid Crystal Display (LCD): Displays date, time, and messages.
 Buzzer and LEDs: Provides audible and visual alarms to remind the user to take their
medication.
